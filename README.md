In this tournament we will be using [the PyPokerEngine](https://ishikota.github.io/PyPokerEngine/). 

First, install the library.

```console
foo@bar:~$ pip install PyPokerEngine
```

main.py contains a simple simulation function for a game with 10 players, where each starts with 1000 in chips. These are the starting conditions for your bot. Let the best player win!
